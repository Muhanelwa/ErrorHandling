# üìÇ File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate file handling and error handling in Python. These tasks are part of the **File & Exception Handling Module Assignment**.

## üìÅ Files Included

### 1. `read_write_challenge.py`
- **Description**: This script reads the contents of a file named `input.txt`, converts all text to uppercase, and writes the result to a new file called `output.txt`.
- **Objective**: Practice reading and writing files, and modifying file content.
- **How to Use**:
  - Make sure there is a file named `input.txt` in the same folder.
  - Run the script: `python read_write_challenge.py`
  - The output will be saved in `output.txt`.

### 2. `error_handling_lab.py`
- **Description**: This script asks the user to enter a filename. It attempts to open the file and displays its content. If the file does not exist or can't be read, it handles the error gracefully.
- **Objective**: Practice using `try-except` blocks to handle file-related errors.
- **How to Use**:
  - Run the script: `python error_handling_lab.py`
  - Enter a valid or invalid filename to test error handling.

## üí° Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, I learned:
- How to open, read, and write files in Python
- How to use `with` statements for file operations
- How to catch and handle exceptions like `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and others
- How to make Python programs more robust and user-friendly

## üöÄ How to Run
```bash
python read_write_challenge.py
python error_handling_lab.py
